Apple is offering a new repair program that extends coverage for certain MacBook Pro models made between 2011 and 2013 that are exhibiting problems related to video. The program offers either free repairs on affected models, or reimbursement for repairs already paid for by users. The it’s an easy way to check if your MacBook Pro is among those covered by the extension, thanks to Apple’s support tool, and the serial number you can find on your machine’s “About This Mac” dialog box under the menu in OS X. Models that may be affected include the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro, as well as the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display, provided they were manufactured during the 2011 to 2013 time span. Symptoms your machine may be exhibiting if it’s affected include video distortion, lack of video or image despite a powered-on computer, or unexpected system restarts. Only in the case of a Mac actually showing these symptoms should you contact Apple to take advantage of the repair program, since otherwise you most likely don’t have a problem.
