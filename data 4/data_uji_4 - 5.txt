Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has been referred to as a “holy grail” of cryptography. Craig Gentry’s recent solution to the problem, while not efficient enough to be practical, was con- sidered to be a major breakthrough. Since then, much progress has been made in the direction of finding efficient Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes. In this paper we will give a brief introduction to FHE for mathematicians. We will give some of the history and major ideas, we will present some examples of FHE schemes, and we will mention a variety of security assumptions on which FHE schemes have been based. The intended audience is mathematicians at the graduate level or beyond (especially number theorists) who do not necessarily have any background in cryptography. The paper is mostly a survey, though §4.3 gives a number theory proof that does not seem to be in the cryptography literature. In encryption schemes, Bob encrypts a plaintext message to obtain a ciphertext. Alice decrypts the ciphertext to recover the plaintext. In Fully Homomorphic Encryption, parties that do not know the plaintext data can perform computations on it by performing computations on the corresponding ciphertexts.A major application of FHE is to cloud computing. Alice can store her data in “the cloud”, for example, on remote servers that she accesses via the Internet. The cloud has more storage capabilities and computing power than does Alice, so when Alice needs computations to be done on her data, she would like those computations to be done by the cloud. However, Alice doesn’t trust the cloud. Her data might be sensitive (for example, Alice might be a hospital and the data might be patients’ medical records), and Alice would like the cloud to know as little as possible about her data, and about the results of the computations. So Alice sends encrypted data to the cloud, which can perform arithmetic operations on it without learning anything about the original raw data, by performing operations on the encrypted data.
