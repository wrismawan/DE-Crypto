SUMMARY

PLAINTEXT : 
The Arsenal manager moved decisively while he was in Brazil working as a World Cup TV pundit to close a ¬£30m deal for S√°nchez from Barcelona. The Chile forward has been Arsenal‚Äôs player of the season so far, scoring 14 goals in all competitions and making light of any settling-in difficulties.However, Wenger said that Liverpool had also been on the case, as they prepared for life after the Barcelona-bound Luis Su√°rez who, coincidentally, had been an Arsenal target the previous summer. Wenger was worried that the Merseyside club might have had the bargaining power. ‚ÄúI thought Liverpool was a serious candidate [for S√°nchez] because they had Su√°rez going there [to Barcelona] so you think that‚Äôs an easy way to do the deal,‚Äù Wenger said. ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day, the player always has the decision.‚ÄúWas I worried that Liverpool might get S√°nchez? Yes. It could happen. There were some other clubs that were in for him as well. The fact is the transfers at that level today always take time to get every detail right so, because it takes time, you think always that somebody else can come in ‚Äì [like] Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern [Munich] ‚Äì to do the deal.‚ÄùIf things had worked out differently in the summer of last year, Su√°rez might have been lining up for Arsenal against Liverpool and who knows where S√°nchez would have been. Liverpool, though, refused to budge in the face of Arsenal‚Äôs infamous ¬£40,000,001 offer. Wenger said that he was happy with how things had worked out in the end, although it would have been a surprise if he had said anything else.‚ÄúThe history of every big club is made up of many big players that you missed,‚Äù Wenger added. ‚ÄúIt goes on and sometimes you get another one. I wanted to play Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka together. Maybe, if Anelka had stayed [in 1999], Henry would not have become the player he became. Sometimes, it‚Äôs coincidence that decides your destiny.‚Äù
